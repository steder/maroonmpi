ABOUT:

This is an example that illustrates using your own CExtensions that 
share communicators with Python MPI programs.

This also is a proof of concept to show that extension modules can make
use of the MPI environment.

BUILDING:

To compile this example simply:

$ make swig && make



RUN:

Start up python:

$ python
>>> import mpi #import MMPI
>>> mpi.init()
>>> import simplempi # import this new module
>>> simplempi.getrank()

Or simply:

$ python test.py

Assuming you see no errors the code ran successfully.
