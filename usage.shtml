      <h2>Running MPI Programs</h2>
      <h3>Using MPICH1</h3>
      <P>I currently don't use or support MPICH1.  According to the MPICH
        developers MPICH2 is backwards compatible and mature enough for 
        serious use.  As MPICH2 is also very easy to use and has a number
        of nice features, I would seriously recommend using MPICH2.  
      </P>
      <p>However, if you have success with MMPI on MPICH1 and would like to 
        share how you setup your system send me an e-mail.  I would be more
        then willing to post some directions here for people who must use
        MPICH1.
        </p>
      <p>If you're trying to get MMPI running on MPICH1 or another unsupported
        MPI Implementation please feel free to ask me questions.  I don't 
        guarantee I can help but I am interested in getting MMPI running 
        on as many platforms as possible.
      </p>
      <h3>Using MPICH2</h3>
      <h4>Starting MPD</h4>
      <p>MPD is a service (unix people might be more familiar with daemons),
        that must be running to start parallel jobs using mpirun or mpiexec
        on MPICH2.  
      </p>
      <p>Depending on your system you may have MPD already running.  You 
        can check to see if there is an MPD running by running the following
        programs:</p>
      <div id="code"><pre><code>
$ mpdtrace
      </code></pre></div>
      <p>If the above command works it should print a list of hostnames(one per line).</p>
      <p>If instead of a list of hostnames you see the following:</p>
      <div id="code"><pre><code>
sakura:~/Projects/mikempi steder$ mpdtrace
mpdtrace: cannot connect to local mpd (/tmp/mpd2.console_steder); possible causes:
  1. no mpd is running on this host
  2. an mpd is running but was started without a "console" (-n option)      
      </code></pre></div>
      <p>Then you will need to start MPD yourself.</p>
      <p>Before we can start MPD as a user we should make sure that you have 
        an mpd configuration file in your home directory.  On my home machine
        ~steder/.mpd.conf consists of a single line:</p>
      <div id="code"><pre><code>
MPD_SECRETWORD=hello
      </code></pre></div>
      <p>You should probably use a different secret word then "hello" most likely.  </p>
      <p>At this point you are ready to start MPD:</p>
      <div id="code"><pre><code>
$ mpdboot --totalnum=4 --file=machinefile.txt --rsh=rsh --user=steder
      </code></pre></div>
      <p>The above command is fairly common.  It says that you are setting up
        an MPD service that will use 4 machines (the first 4 hostnames listed
        in machinefile.txt (one hostname per line)) and log into them using
        the systems "rsh" command (it's common to substitute "ssh" for "rsh").
        Additionally it should connect as the user "steder".</p>
      <p>There are many more options available to mpdboot.</p>
      <p>NOTE:  The above seems a bit complicated, and it is for a simple test.
        However, for simple cases you can simply use "mpdboot" without 
        any arguments to test that your MPI environment and MMPI are working.</p>
      <h4>Using mpiexec</h4>
      <p>mpiexec is the MPICH2 replacement for mpirun.  Many of the options
        to mpiexec are the same as the mpirun options, although there are a 
        few additions and new features.</p>
      <p>Assuming you have a running MPD, executing a MMPI program is
        quite simple.</p>
      <p>The following is a minimal MMPI program.</p>
      <div id="code"><pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/env python
#file:  hello.py
import sys,mpi
rank, numprocs = mpi.init(len(sys.argv),sys.argv)
print "Hello World from Processor %s of %s!"%( rank+1, numprocs )
mpi.finalize()
      </code></pre></div>
      <p>You can run the above program on <em>N</em> processors using
        the following command</p>
      <div id="terminal"><pre><code>
$ mpiexec -l -n N /usr/bin/python2.4 /home/steder/hello.py
      </code></pre></div>
      <p>Of course you should fill in the appropriate paths instead of
        /usr/bin and /home/steder (or include those files and paths in 
        your PATH.</p>
      <p>After running the above command you should see the following output</p>
      <div id="terminal"><pre><code>
Hello World from Processor 1 of N!
Hello World from Processor 2 of N!
...
Hello World from Processor N of N!
      </code></pre></div>
